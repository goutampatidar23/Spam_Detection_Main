# spam-detection-
spam detection using javafx and my sql
In this code, we create a simple spam detection system using JavaFX. The system allows the user to enter a message, and when the "Detect" button is clicked, it queries a MySQL database table called "messages" to check if the message is classified as spam or not.

Make sure to replace "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/spam_detection", "root", and "password" in the DB_URL, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD constants with the appropriate values for your MySQL database.

Note that this is a simplified example and does not include the actual implementation of a spam detection algorithm. It assumes that the database already contains the messages and their corresponding spam classification. In a production application, you would need to train a spam detection model and use it to classify messages. Additionally, you may need to download and set up the necessary dependencies for JavaFX and the MySQL JDBC driver to run this code successfully.
